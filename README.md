# Graph Project 7: Graph ADT Implementation README
## Overview
Graph Project 7 in CSE 331 FS23 provides a comprehensive implementation of a Graph Abstract Data Type (ADT) using an Adjacency Map structure. This project introduces concepts such as vertex and edge representations, A* search algorithm, and various graph operations.

## Key Features
Vertex Class: Represents a vertex in the graph with unique ID, adjacency list, visitation status, and optional coordinates for A* search.<br />
Graph Class: Implements the Graph ADT with functionalities like adding vertices and edges, converting between matrices and graphs, BFS, and A* search.<br />
PriorityQueue Class: A helper class to facilitate the A* search algorithm.<br />
Teleportation Functionality: Demonstrates an application of the graph ADT in a teleportation network across different galaxies.<br />
Core Functionalities<br />
Vertex Operations:<br />
Degree calculation, outgoing edge retrieval, and Euclidean/Taxicab distance calculations.<br />
Graph Operations:<br />
Adding vertices and edges, converting graph to matrix and vice versa, unvisiting vertices, BFS, and A* search using a specified metric.<br />
Priority Queue:<br />
Supports priority updates, essential for efficient implementation of A* search.<br />
Teleportation Network Calculation:<br />
Computes the shortest path and its cost in a teleportation network spanning multiple galaxies.<br />

## Installation
No special installation is required beyond Python 3.7 or newer.

## Dependencies
Python 3.7+<br />
NumPy (for matrix manipulation)<br />
Optional: Matplotlib (for graph plotting)<br />
